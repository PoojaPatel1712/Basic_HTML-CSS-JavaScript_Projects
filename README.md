# Welcome to my 7-day coding challenge!
In this repository, I'll be building 7 projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to learn new coding techniques and improve my skills in web development.

## Overview
Each project is designed to be beginner-friendly, so even if you're new to coding, you'll find plenty of ideas and inspiration here. The projects range from responsive landing pages to dynamic image galleries, and each one will showcase what I can do with just a little bit of code.

## Updates
I'll be updating this repository every day with a new project, so be sure to check back often to see what I've created.

## Getting Started
If you're interested in learning more about web development or just want to see what I can come up with, this is the perfect place to start.
